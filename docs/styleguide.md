# Styleguide — branding for `de.medizininformatikinitiative.template`

The layout and design conventions of this template: what the branding is, which
rules keep it consistent and accessible, and which boundaries must not be
crossed. The template carries **two switchable corporate designs** — **NUM-DIZ**
(the default — NUM-DIZ takes over IG development and maintenance when MII
funding ends end-2026) and **MII** (selected by the explicit brand value
`"mii"`); §10 documents the switch and the NUM-DIZ design, §§2–8 the MII
design and the rules both share. Every color and
asset traces to a file that MII, NUM-DIZ or HL7 publishes; the full
source-by-source derivation (URLs, checksums, pixel analyses) is preserved in
this repository's git history (`docs/design.md`, the styleguide's
predecessor). Follow-ups on the logo assets (an official SVG, trademark
permission — for NUM-DIZ: pending brand-use consent, §10) are tracked in
the issue tracker ([#25](../../../issues/25), [#26](../../../issues/26),
[#109](../../../issues/109), [#110](../../../issues/110)).

## 1. Inheritance rules (how this template extends the base)

The template derives from `fhir2.base.template` (pinned `0.1.0`) — the
language-aware base both MII reference repos use. The rules:

- **Override only the base's extension points.** What the template ships on top
  of the base is exactly: `includes/fragment-header.html` and
  `includes/fragment-css.html` (the base's *designed* child extension points —
  empty placeholders), `includes/fragment-footer.html` (not a placeholder: the
  override preserves the base's link structure and appends to it),
  `includes/fragment-language.html` (verbatim copy fixing ONE base defect: the
  base hardcodes the literal "Language:" instead of reading its own
  stringsBase catalog, so the label never translated — the override reads the
  catalog with the English literal as fallback; delete it the day the pinned
  base reads its catalog there), `includes/template-page-md.html` (verbatim
  copy fixing the translation notice: the base prints it with an inline style
  instead of `ig-highlight`, and only on pages without a table of contents —
  the override uses `ig-highlight ig-highlight-grey` in both branches; delete
  it the day the pinned base does the same),
  `includes/structure-tabs.html` (an added authoring include with no base
  counterpart — [recipe](recipes/tab-an-artifact-structure.md)), four CSS
  files (`content/assets/css/bootstrap-accessibility.css` — the vendored
  Bootstrap-3 accessibility patch, §8 — then
  `content/assets/css/template-base.css`, the brand-independent rule
  blocks, always linked; then exactly ONE palette file —
  `content/assets/css/num-diz.css` by default, `content/assets/css/mii.css`
  only when the brand switch selects MII — §10), the logo/favicon assets, the vendored German
  UI catalogs in `translations/`, and four JS assets:
  `content/assets/js/lang-redirects.js`, `font-size-control.js` and
  `back-to-top.js` (both §8), and the vendored
  `bootstrap-accessibility.min.js` (pinned byte-exact, §8).
  > **The two same-path replacements are on borrowed time.**
  > `content/assets/js/lang-redirects.js` and `content/assets/ico/favicon.png`
  > win only because a child template's file at the same path beats the base's.
  > That makes them invisible drift: a base change to either file is silently
  > discarded. The favicon is intentional and permanent (it is branding);
  > `lang-redirects.js` carries the fix for a defect in the pinned base's
  > landing-page redirect and has a deletion condition attached — the reason is
  > written out in the file itself, the follow-up in
  > [issue #122](../../../issues/122).
- **Never ship `config.json`, `layouts/`, `liquid/`, `scripts/` or a
  `translations/stringsBase.json`.** The IG Publisher *replaces* (does not
  merge) these per template directory — a copy forks the whole base and
  silently detaches from base updates. This is also why the template cannot add
  new `stringsBase` keys of its own.
- **Never override `fragment-pageend.html`** (or other core layout fragments).
  It is core page layout; a vendored copy risks breaking the whole style on a
  base-template bump. This was tried and deliberately reverted — the known
  consequence (the publisher name in the © line stays English on `/de/`) is
  accepted; see [limitations](#7-recorded-limitations-do-not-fix-by-workaround).
- **Colour is variables-only.** Each palette file (`num-diz.css` / `mii.css`)
  re-colours the guide exclusively through custom properties — the ones the
  base declares in `project.css` `:root` plus the template's own
  `--ig-table-*` and `--ig-highlight-*` — no base colour rule is re-declared,
  so a re-theme is a one-file edit with no cascade surprises. Both palettes
  declare the same variable set (guarded by `scripts/brand-switch.test.mjs`);
  exactly one is loaded per build. The rule blocks that are *not* about colour
  live in `template-base.css`: the highlight boxes (§3), the narrative-table
  styling (§5), the content-image handling and the structure-tabs spacing
  (§5a). Three of them add new classes; the content-image block is the only
  place where a base rule is deliberately countermanded.
- **When re-syncing an overridden fragment against a bumped base:** port
  structural changes only; do not restore the base's `stringsBase` label
  lookups in the footer (they render blank on `/de/` — §6).

## 2. Color palette (MII design)

Use these tokens and no others; no raw hex outside `mii.css` and
`num-diz.css` (the NUM-DIZ palette is in §10).

| Role | Hex | Use for | Never for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MII slate | `#7a8495` | narrative-table borders, grey-hint border | text backgrounds (white on it is 3.78:1 — fails AA) |
| MII slate-dark | `#6a7484` | footer (both bands), IG title/status text, menu-active | — |
| MII blue | `#3473aa` | navbar, menu buttons, link hover | — |
| MII link blue | `#5773a2` | body links, menu hover, gradients | — |
| MII accent green | `#9abc31` | the top stripe, decorative accents | **any text surface** (white on it is 2.18:1) |
| MII vivid green | `#71b800` | logo artwork only | text surfaces (2.45:1 on white) |
| MII teal | `#528a94` | logo artwork only; reserved | text (white on it is 3.87:1) |
| Body text | `#333333` | text on white/light surfaces | — |
| Light background | `#ebedef` | breadcrumb, narrative-table headers | — |

The footer is **one uniform grey** (`#6a7484` for band *and* container):
slate-dark rather than the MII site's own footer slate because text sits on the
footer here, and white on true slate fails AA. Do not reintroduce the two-tone
band — it reads as a seam.

The page chrome at the top is **consistently white**: header sides and header
container are both `#ffffff` (the base ships three different light shades,
which read as an inconsistent white/grey mix). The green stripe and the blue
navbar provide the visual structure; the breadcrumb keeps `#ebedef` as a subtle
functional band.

Variables deliberately **not** overridden (they are IG-Publisher semantic
signals, not brand surfaces): publish box, TOC box, STU note, footer-nav strip,
dragon, translation box.

## 3. Highlight boxes

Five reusable classes for calling out content in narrative pages
(`<div class="ig-highlight ig-highlight-<color>">` with an `<h5>` heading, or
a kramdown attribute line `{: .ig-highlight .ig-highlight-<color>}` under a
blockquote). Styling only — a module decides what each color means; the
conventional reading:

> **Renamed 2026-08-14:** the class prefix is now the brand-neutral `ig-*` (formerly `mii-*`).
> The old `.mii-highlight*` selectors and `--mii-table-*` variables remain as **deprecated
> aliases** so existing module content keeps rendering; they will be removed in the next major.

| Class | Conventional meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ig-highlight-blue` | neutral call-out |
| `ig-highlight-green` | positive/confirming note |
| `ig-highlight-orange` | warning |
| `ig-highlight-red` | important notice |
| `ig-highlight-grey` | hint / authoring note (all `[TODO: …]` prompts use it) |

The box STRUCTURE lives in `template-base.css`; the colours are
`--ig-highlight-<variant>-{bg,border,heading}-color` palette variables, so
**each corporate design brings its own set** (TF-KDS feedback 2026-08-14):

| Variant | MII (`mii.css`): bg / border / heading | NUM-DIZ (`num-diz.css`): bg / border / heading | NUM-DIZ source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| blue | `#e8f4f8` / `#5c8db3` / `#406a99` | `#e8f1f8` / `#1d6fa8` / `#16537e` | DIZ wordmark blue `#1d6fa8` |
| green | `#f0f8e8` / `#91bc3d` / `#5a6b2f` | `#f3f8e2` / `#587f4e` / `#42590a` | DIZ emblem greens `#8dbc0b`/`#6ea460`, darkened |
| orange | `#fdf3e7` / `#c9721c` / `#8a4b12` | `#fff7db` / `#a38200` / `#6e5800` | NUM yellow `#ffcc00`, darkened |
| red | `#fbeaea` / `#c0392b` / `#8f2318` | `#fdedf0` / `#ea5167` / `#9c2038` | NUM-DIZ coral itself |
| grey | `#f2f3f5` / `#7a8495` / `#4a5260` | `#f0f1f2` / `#706f6f` / `#485156` | site greys + slate |

MII set: heading-on-background ≥ 6.1:1 (AA); the orange/red/grey borders
≥ 3.2:1 (WCAG 1.4.11). The inherited green border sits below the 3:1
non-text bar — kept for parity with kerndatensatz-basis; do not copy that
compromise into new variants. NUM-DIZ set: every variant passes BOTH bars —
heading-on-background ≥ 6.4:1 and border-on-background ≥ 3.16:1 (no green
exception; guarded by `scripts/brand-switch.test.mjs`).

## 4. Logo, favicon, assets

- The logo ships as **SVG, traced from the official PNGs** (MII publishes no
  brand SVG — the site's only SVG is the "10 Jahre" anniversary mark). This is
  a conversion, not an official asset: **replace both files the day the MII
  publishes a real SVG.** The exact reproduction commands live in
  [replace-the-logo.md](recipes/replace-the-logo.md); source URLs and checksums
  are preserved in git history (`docs/design.md`).
- **Two language variants** (`logo-de.svg`, `logo-en.svg`) because the wordmark
  text differs; `fragment-header.html` switches on `include.lang == 'de'`,
  non-`de` languages get the EN logo. Layout: project logo in `#project-nav`
  (base's project slot, `height="50"`), HL7 FHIR family logo in `#family-nav`
  linking to <https://hl7.org/fhir> — mirroring kerndatensatz-basis. A module
  overriding `input/includes/fragment-header.html` replaces the fragment
  wholesale and must re-add both logos if it wants them.
- The **NUM-DIZ logo pair** (`logo-num-diz-de.svg`, `logo-num-diz-en.svg`)
  follows the same per-language pattern and renders **by default**; the MII
  pair renders instead when the brand switch selects MII. Provenance and
  approval status are documented in §10.
- **Asset naming:** language-specific assets use `<name>-<lang>.<ext>`. Names
  dictated by other tools keep that tool's spelling: `favicon.png` (browser
  convention) and `deu.svg` — **never rename it**: the IG Publisher derives the
  flag file name from the IG's jurisdiction (`urn:iso:std:iso:3166#DE` → the
  ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code). A different jurisdiction expects a different name
  (`aut.svg` for Austria).
- The favicon overrides the base's FHIR-flame icon by shipping the same path
  (`content/assets/ico/favicon.png`); the base's `rel="fhir-logo"` links stay
  untouched.

## 5. Narrative tables

Markdown tables in page content get, once, in `mii.css` (the base styles only
publisher-generated tables; kerndatensatz-basis compensates per page with
inline `<style>` blocks):

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Header background | `#ebedef` |
| Header text | `#333333` |
| Border | `1px solid #7a8495` |
| Padding | `6px 10px` |

**Guardrails:**

- The selector must exclude `[class]`, `[style]`, `[border]` and `[data-fhir]`.
  The obvious `table:not([class])` is **wrong**: the publisher's profile trees
  carry no class, only presentation attributes, and the short selector repaints
  them (34 generated tables, measured). What separates the two kinds is that a
  markdown table has *no attributes at all*.
  `scripts/narrative-table-styles.test.mjs` asserts the behaviour against
  fixtures from the built output — keep it passing; never "simplify" the
  selector.
- **No `width: 100%`** (kerndatensatz-basis sets it; this template does not):
  full width stretches two-column tables across the page. A module may add it
  for its own tables.

## 5a. The rule blocks in `template-base.css`

Colour is variables-only (§1) and lives in the palette files; the six rule
blocks that go beyond variables live in the brand-independent
`template-base.css`. Five of them add *new* classes, which cannot collide
with the base; one deliberately overrides base rules. Anything added here has
to earn its place, because a rule the base later changes will silently keep
the value set here.

| Block | Selectors | New or override | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Highlight boxes (§3) | `.ig-highlight`, `.ig-highlight-<color>` (+ their `h5`) | new classes | Reusable, purpose-neutral callouts for page authors, carried over from `kerndatensatz-basis`. Styling only — a module decides what each colour means |
| Narrative tables (§5) | `table:not([class]):not([style]):not([border]):not([data-fhir])` and its `th`/`td` | new rules on markdown tables the base leaves unstyled | Detailed in §5, including why the obvious short selector is wrong |
| Content images | `#segment-content p > img:not(.float)`, `#segment-content img` | **overrides base rules** | The base floats every `p > img` and caps no width, so a diagram wraps body text beside it and a wide one overflows the column. Content images are block-centred and width-capped instead; a small inline image opts back into the base behaviour with `class="float"` |
| Structure tabs | `.structure-tabs`, `.structure-tabs .tab-content` | new classes | Spacing and a scroll container for `includes/structure-tabs.html` — [recipe](recipes/tab-an-artifact-structure.md) |
| Font-size control (§8) | `.ig-fontsize`, `html[data-fontsize]` over the four reading regions | new classes | Reader-selectable A/A+/A++ levels (2026-08-15). Level A = NO rule — the default renders byte-identical to a build without the feature. Levels apply `zoom` to `#segment-content`, `#segment-navbar`, `#segment-breadcrumb` and `#segment-footer` as siblings (standardized in CSS Viewport; scales the publisher-generated tables' INLINE px font sizes too and reflows; only the header band keeps its fitted layout); print resets to 100 %. Colors are palette variables only; hover shares the chrome convention (§8). **REMOVAL is one commit:** this block, `assets/js/font-size-control.js`, and the `.ig-fontsize` block in `includes/fragment-header.html`. Guarded by `scripts/font-size-control.test.mjs` |
| Back-to-top button (§8) | `.ig-back-to-top` | new classes | Fixed bottom-right jump-to-top after one viewport of scrolling (2026-08-16); solid light ground so it stays visible over the slate footer; reduced-motion-aware; outside the zoom regions. **REMOVAL is one commit:** this block, `assets/js/back-to-top.js` and the header markup block. Guarded by `scripts/back-to-top.test.mjs` |

`template-base.css` is linked after the base stylesheets
(`includes/fragment-css.html`), so none of these needs `!important`. The
content-image block is the only place where a base rule is deliberately
countermanded; if the base ever changes its image handling, that block is the
first thing to re-check. (A navbar-typography override — 19px bold links to
reach the WCAG large-text bar on the coral navbar — shipped briefly in v1.1.0
and was reverted on TF-KDS review: the enlarged menu did not fit visually.
The navbar keeps the base's default typography; the contrast consequence is a
recorded limitation, §7.)

## 6. Language rules

- `{% if include.lang == 'de' %}` branches switch **assets and link targets
  only** — never inline translated body copy (kerndatensatz-basis' own header
  pattern). The one recorded exception: the footer's visible labels
  (`Links`, `Inhaltsverzeichnis`/`Table of Contents`, `QA-Bericht`/`QA Report`,
  `Impressum`/`Legal notice`) are hard-coded per language, because the pinned
  base ships no German catalog and its label mechanism renders **blank** on
  `/de/` — and the base has no Imprint key at all. Adding a third language
  means extending this label branch.
- The footer appends (never replaces) the base's link row, and adds:
  `netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de` (before the MII link because NUM-DIZ
  takes over IG maintenance — rendered in both brand designs),
  `medizininformatik-initiative.de` (bare domains as anchor text are
  language-neutral) plus the imprint — the NUM-DIZ legal pages, `de` →
  `/impressum`, otherwise → `/en/legal-notice`.
- **"MII" naming policy** (funding ends 2026; NUM-DIZ takes over — every MII
  mention will be re-evaluated): "MII" appears only in **proper names and
  identifiers** — the *MII Core Dataset / MII-Kerndatensatz* (the dataset's
  name), the *MII Broad Consent*, the `MII_*` artifact-naming conventions,
  package ids / canonical URLs / org and site links — and in **past-tense
  provenance** ("was created within…"). Statements about ongoing processes,
  scope or governance are phrased **time-robustly** instead: "KDS-wide", "the
  Meta module", "the governance bodies of the core-dataset process", "the
  overarching data protection concept". Do not write MII as the acting
  institution of a present-tense sentence.
- The template vendors the base's own `stringsBase-de.po` /
  `stringsArtifacts-de.po` into `translations/` for the rest of the base
  chrome. Vendored catalogs may differ from upstream in `msgstr` values only.
  Delete both once the pinned base ships `de` itself
  ([translations/README.md](../translations/README.md),
  [add-translation.md](recipes/add-translation.md)).
- Page titles (breadcrumbs, TOC, section captions) translate through the
  IG-resource catalog `input/translations/de/ImplementationGuide-<id>.po` —
  every page needs an `ImplementationGuide.definition.page.title` entry there,
  including "Table of Contents".
- The only other literal texts allowed are bare URLs and `alt` texts quoting
  the proper name of the logo variant shown.
- The HL7 trademark attribution in the footer stays **English on every
  language's pages**: it is HL7's prescribed legal formula, not translatable
  UI text (rendered because the header shows the FHIR flame on every page —
  guard-tested in `scripts/brand-switch.test.mjs`; the community-use
  permission request remains a maintainer action, [issue #109](../../../issues/109)).

## 7. Recorded limitations (do not fix by workaround)

- **Publisher name in the © line stays English on `/de/`.** The base's
  `fragment-pageend.html` renders the single global IG publisher on every
  language's pages; per-language data does not exist, and kerndatensatz-basis
  ships the same limitation live. An override was tried and reverted (§1). The
  durable fix is upstream: a translatable publisher label in
  `HL7/ig-template-base2`. The publisher **link** is language-neutral
  (`https://www.netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de` — NUM-DIZ is the publisher
  since 2026-08-14, §10).
- **The NUM-DIZ navbar's resting contrast is 3.58:1** (white on coral
  `#ea5167`) — below the 4.5:1 the rest of the template keeps (§8). A TF-KDS
  decision (2026-08-14): the menu carries the site's own nav coral, and the
  WCAG *large-text* variant (19px bold links, which would make 3:1 the
  applicable bar) was rejected on review because the enlarged menu did not fit
  visually. Accepted as corporate-design-over-1.4.3 for the navbar's resting
  state only — hover and active states hold 8.12:1 / 5.21:1, dropdown items
  never sit on coral, and `scripts/brand-switch.test.mjs` still enforces a
  3:1 floor so the surface cannot silently regress further. Revisit if an
  accessibility review (BITV/EN 301 549) requires strict 1.4.3 conformance.
- **Footer links are white like the surrounding text** (exactly like the MII
  site footer) and distinguishable only on hover (WCAG 1.4.1). Accepted —
  fixing it needs a rule override, which §1 forbids. Revisit only if an
  accessibility review requires underlines (one rule would suffice).
- **The preview's "Directory of published versions" link is dead.** The link is
  the IG's `canonical` + `history.html`; the preview's canonical is the GitHub
  repo URL and the preview is never formally published. Inert, preview-only
  chrome — a module's real canonical yields a working link.

## 8. Accessibility requirements

Every text-bearing surface must hold WCAG 2.1 AA (≥ 4.5:1 normal text) and
every meaningful non-text edge ≥ 3:1 (1.4.11) — **in both brand designs**
(the NUM-DIZ ratios are in §10). Current measured MII values — keep
them true when changing any color:

| Surface | Colors | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navbar / menu buttons | `#ffffff` on `#3473aa` | 5.03:1 |
| Menu hover | `#ffffff` on `#5773a2` | 4.80:1 |
| Menu active / footer | `#ffffff` on `#6a7484` | 4.73:1 |
| Body links | `#5773a2` on `#ffffff` | 4.80:1 |
| Link hover | `#3473aa` on `#ffffff` | 5.03:1 |
| IG title/status | `#6a7484` on `#ffffff` | 4.73:1 |
| Breadcrumb, table headers | `#333333` on `#ebedef` | 10.77:1 |
| Narrative-table border | `#7a8495` on `#ffffff` / `#ebedef` | 3.78:1 / 3.22:1 |

Conventions derived from the measurements: the accent greens and teal are
decorative-only (they fail on text); `--btn-text-color` stays `#ffffff` (the
base's `#e6e6e6` is 4.03:1 on the navbar blue); the language dropdown reads
white on navbar blue (5.03:1).

### Back-to-top button

IG pages get very long; the fixed bottom-right button appears after about
one viewport of scrolling and jumps back, moving focus to the page-top
anchor so keyboard users land where they jumped. Written as an own asset
(`assets/js/back-to-top.js`) instead of wiring the base's dormant
`topofpage.js`, which fades in at 50px, fires a tooltip on load and ignores
`prefers-reduced-motion` — ours scrolls smoothly only without that
preference. Rendered inside `#segment-header`, outside the `data-fontsize`
zoom regions, so it never scales with A+/A++. Colors are the font-size
control's inactive pair on a SOLID light ground (`--ig-header-container-color`
— white in both palettes — with slate border/glyph, slate fill on hover): a
slate-filled button was the same variable value as the footer and vanished
when the two crossed. **REMOVAL is one commit:** the js asset, the
`template-base.css` block and the header markup block — guarded by
`scripts/back-to-top.test.mjs`.

### Widget semantics — the vendored Bootstrap-3 accessibility patch

The publisher's pages run on Bootstrap 3, whose components are semantically
thin (tab-only dropdowns, no ARIA tabs pattern). The template vendors the
**PayPal Bootstrap Accessibility Plugin v1.0.7** (pinned byte-exact by
`scripts/bootstrap-accessibility.test.mjs`) as a runtime patch over the
markup the publisher generates: navbar dropdowns gain ARIA menu semantics
and arrow-key navigation, tab panels (the `structure-tabs` include) the full
ARIA tabs pattern with arrow keys, alerts live-region announcements; the
small CSS adds focus outlines and alert-contrast fixes and loads before
`template-base.css` so the template can override. Upstream is
feature-complete/minimally maintained — coherent against the frozen
Bootstrap 3; the Swiss federal `admin-ch` fork was evaluated and rejected
(151 commits behind upstream; its six own commits are site-specific tab
tweaks). REMOVAL is one commit: both vendored assets, the `fragment-css`
link and the `fragment-header` script tag.

### Text resize (WCAG 1.4.4)

Browser zoom remains the primary resize mechanism (the layout is responsive
to 200 %). The A/A+/A++ control (§5a) is an *additional* reader aid at +12.5 %
and +25 % on the content region — chosen because the publisher-generated
artifact tables carry inline `font-size: 11px` styles that user stylesheets
and inherited font sizes cannot reach, while `zoom` scales them. Level A is
always the untouched default.

## 9. How to review a branding change

1. Build the preview — push a branch and CI comments the URL, or run the IG
   Publisher locally on any IG whose `ig.ini` says
   `template = #<folder-holding-a-copy-of-this-repo>` (the leading `#` marks a
   local folder).
2. Compare the rendered header/footer/navbar against
   <https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/> and a kerndatensatz-basis
   build.
3. To change a value, edit the hex in `mii.css` (MII design) or `num-diz.css`
   (NUM-DIZ design) or the assets in `content/assets/images/` — no other file
   needs to change. Re-check §8's/§10's ratios for any color you touch.
4. When the change touches a brand-switched surface (CSS variables, header
   logo, footer), build **twice** — once without `input/data/brand.json`
   (the NUM-DIZ default) and once with `{ "design": "mii" }` (the MII
   design) — and review both; `scripts/brand-switch.test.mjs` guards the
   switch's invariants offline.

## 10. The brand switch: NUM-DIZ corporate design

NUM-DIZ (Netzwerk Universitätsmedizin — Datenintegrationszentren) takes over
IG development and maintenance when MII funding ends (end-2026). The template
therefore carries the NUM-DIZ corporate design — and renders it **by
default**: a module that does nothing gets the NUM-DIZ design. The MII design
stays fully available as the switchable second brand.

### The switch

The default needs no file at all. To render the **MII** design instead, one
file in the consuming IG, set once:

```json
// input/data/brand.json
{ "design": "mii" }
```

The base template's pre-process copies `input/data/` into Jekyll's `_data`
(`fhir2.base.template` `config.json`, `pre-process` block), so the fragments
read the value as `site.data.brand.design`. This is a **designed** module-side
surface — no template file is overridden, and the doctrine of §1 is untouched.
The switch keeps the exact-match doctrine, now anchored on `'mii'`: every
branch tests `site.data.brand.design == 'mii'` exactly, and **only** that
value selects the MII design — a missing file, an empty file, or any unknown
value falls through to the NUM-DIZ default. Recipe:
[switch-brand-to-mii.md](recipes/switch-brand-to-mii.md).

The switch covers exactly three surfaces:

| Surface | NUM-DIZ (default) | MII (`{ "design": "mii" }`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Palette | `num-diz.css` — the **only** palette linked (after the brand-independent `template-base.css`) | `mii.css` — the **only** palette linked; both declare the same variable set |
| Header logo (per language) | `logo-num-diz-de.svg` / `logo-num-diz-en.svg` → the [NUM-DIZ page](https://www.netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de/forschung/num-diz) | `logo-de.svg` / `logo-en.svg` → medizininformatik-initiative.de |
| Brand-named text | the logo `alt` texts (the only brand-named chrome text) | ditto, MII wording |

Deliberately **not** switched: the footer's link row (the NUM-DIZ link renders
in both designs, the MII links stay — the modules remain MII content), the
highlight-box class names and the `--ig-table-*` variable names (API names,
not display text), and the favicon (its `<link>` lives in the base's
`fragment-pagebegin.html`, which §1 forbids overriding — a recorded limitation
of the NUM-DIZ design).

### NUM-DIZ color palette

Measured from <https://www.netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de> (theme
`styles.css`, stock Bootstrap values excluded) and the vendored logo SVGs,
retrieved 2026-08-13. Use these tokens and no others.

| Role | Hex | Use for | Never for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NUM-DIZ slate | `#485156` | menu hover, footer, IG title/status text, breadcrumb/table text, link hover | — |
| NUM-DIZ slate-blue | `#5c6f7e` | body links, menu active, gradients (combo-logo wordmark fill) | — |
| NUM-DIZ coral | `#ea5167` | **navbar** (TF-KDS 2026-08-14; white links at 3.58:1 — recorded limitation, §7), the top stripe (stripe and navbar merge into one coral band), the red highlight-box border (§3), decorative accents | body text and any other text surface (3.58:1 — below the 4.5:1 bar the template keeps everywhere but the navbar) |
| NUM-DIZ teal | `#42d1b8` | logo artwork only; reserved | text (1.90:1 on white) |
| NUM yellow | `#ffcc00` | logo artwork only; reserved | text surfaces |
| Mid grey | `#706f6f` | narrative-table borders | menu surfaces (read muddy on the coral navbar; dropped 2026-08-14) |
| Light grey | `#ecedee` | breadcrumb, narrative-table headers | — |

The same design decisions as the MII palette apply: one uniform footer grey
(no two-tone seam), consistently white header chrome, and the base's
IG-Publisher semantic signals (publish box, STU note, …) are left alone.

### NUM-DIZ contrast (WCAG 2.1)

| Surface | Colors | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navbar resting | `#ffffff` on `#ea5167` | 3.58:1 (**recorded limitation** — TF-KDS decision, §7) |
| Menu hover / footer | `#ffffff` on `#485156` | 8.12:1 (AAA) |
| Menu active / gradient end | `#ffffff` on `#5c6f7e` | 5.21:1 |
| Body links | `#5c6f7e` on `#ffffff` | 5.21:1 |
| Link hover / IG title/status | `#485156` on `#ffffff` | 8.12:1 |
| Breadcrumb, table headers | `#485156` on `#ecedee` | 6.93:1 |
| Narrative-table border | `#706f6f` on `#ffffff` / `#ecedee` | 5.01:1 / 4.27:1 |

Derived conventions: the navbar carries the site's own nav coral since
2026-08-14 (TF-KDS feedback: the grey menu did not complement the coral header
stripe) at the base template's default link typography — its 3.58:1 resting
contrast is a **recorded limitation** (§7), with a 3:1 floor still enforced by
`scripts/brand-switch.test.mjs`. Everywhere else coral and teal
stay decorative-only, and the site's own body-link coral
(`a { color: #EA5167 }` in its stylesheet, 3.58:1) is still **not** adopted —
the slate-blue from the official combo-logo wordmark is the closest sourced
value that holds AA for normal-size text.

### NUM-DIZ logos: provenance and approval

- `logo-num-diz-de.svg` — the official German combination logo
  (`NUM-DIZ-Kombilogo-POS-RGB.svg`), vendored **byte-identical** from the
  NUM-DIZ website on 2026-08-13 (only a provenance comment was added).
- `logo-num-diz-en.svg` — vectorized on 2026-08-17 from the **official
  English combination logo** (`NUM-DIZ-Kombilogo-POS-RGB_EN.png`, 5423 x 1198
  px at 300 dpi, provided by NUM-DIZ; sha256 pinned in the file's header
  comment). The DIC portion (wordmark, network emblem, both text bands) is a
  color-separated potrace vectorization of that raster; its five flat inks
  are snapped to the exact fill values the official German vector uses for
  the same artwork (`#1e6fa8`/`#94c119`/`#6ea460`/`#428997`/`#5c6f7e`). The
  NUM portion (star emblem with its gradients, NUM wordmark, subtitle) is the
  official English NUM vector logo, registered onto the raster by a landmark
  fit over the star's red/yellow balls (residual < 0.1 canvas units). The
  canvas equals the German combo's frame (1301.318 x 287.5), so both language
  versions render with identical proportions at any given height. This file
  replaced the earlier unofficial derivation (issue #111, closed); the full
  method is in the file's own header comment.
- **Approval status: brand-use consent pending.** The NUM/NUM-DIZ logos are
  third-party brand assets; shipping them requires NUM-DIZ consent. Since
  NUM-DIZ became the **default** design, every rendering that does not opt
  back to MII ships these logos — the consent is not gating an opt-in extra
  but the out-of-the-box output. Tracked in [#110](../../../issues/110).
