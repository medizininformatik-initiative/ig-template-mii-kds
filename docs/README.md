# Documentation

Start with the [recipes](recipes/) if you have a task in hand. This page is the
map of everything else.

You do not edit this repository to write an IG — you reference it. To *use* the
template in a module, see
[recipes/consume-this-template-in-a-module.md](recipes/consume-this-template-in-a-module.md).
Everything else here is about changing the template itself.

## Reading order for a newcomer

1. [glossary.md](glossary.md) — the vocabulary, so the rest reads faster.
2. [concepts.md](concepts.md) — what this package is, and what it is not.
3. [recipes/first-build-in-devcontainer.md](recipes/first-build-in-devcontainer.md)
   — get a build before changing anything.
4. [styleguide.md](styleguide.md) — the layout/design conventions; the full source derivations are preserved in git history (`docs/design.md`).

## What is a recommendation and what is a rule

Almost everything here is **this template's** own choice or a recommendation. It
is not MII policy: the MII's published rules live in the KDS governance and on
the [MII website](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/), and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) says which of them apply.

The exceptions — things that genuinely fail a build here — are stated as such in
[workflows.md](workflows.md).
