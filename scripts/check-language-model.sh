# check-language-model.sh — fail if the abandoned "German is the default IG
# language" model reappears anywhere in the repository.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   This IG is English-default with a German translation
#   (`i18n-default-lang: en`, `i18n-lang: [de]`,
#   `translation-sources: [input/translations/de]`) — the same model as
#   kerndatensatz-basis. The repo used to describe the opposite model, and the
#   prose survived the commit that flipped the config: comments, skills and
#   recipes kept calling German the default language and kept pointing at an
#   `input/translations/en/` folder that has never existed. This check makes
#   that class of drift a build failure instead of an audit finding.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   Every tracked text file is grepped for a short list of assertions that are
#   only true under the old model (see PATTERNS). The patterns match the WRONG
#   claim, not the language pair — "English default, German translation" and
#   "the German /de/ pages" are correct statements and must not match.
#   The check is line-based: a claim broken across a line break (as one comment
#   in includes/fragment-footer.html once was) slips through, so a reviewer is
#   still the second line of defence.
#
# WHEN IT FIRES
#   Fix the wording. If a hit is genuinely legitimate, add it to the explicit
#   exception list below with a one-line reason — never loosen a pattern.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/check-language-model.sh          # from anywhere in the checkout
#   Runs in CI on every pull request into `dev`, where changes land
#   (.github/workflows/security-scan.yml).

ERROR: the IG is English-default with a German translation, but the lines above
claim German is the default/leading/source language, or point at an
input/translations/en/ folder that does not exist.
