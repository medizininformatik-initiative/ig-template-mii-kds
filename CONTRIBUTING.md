# Contributing

Thank you for contributing! This guide explains the branching model, the commit
message format, and the pull-request rules. It assumes no prior experience with
this workflow — if a term is new to you, the walkthrough below spells out every
step.

## Branching model

This repo uses a simple two-branch model with short-lived working branches.

### The branches

- **`main` — stable release branch.** Always in a released, buildable state:
  every commit on `main` corresponds to a released (or release-ready) version.
  Protected — no direct pushes. `main` is the repo's **default branch**, so it
  is what visitors see first. Changes are meant to reach it only through a
  `dev → main` merge; where that has not held, and what to do about it, is
  recorded in [docs/org-move.md](docs/org-move.md#branch-state--main-and-dev-are-reconciled).
  > **Why `main` is the default:** newcomers should land on, and start from, the
  > stable state — not work-in-progress.
- **`dev` — integration branch.** Where reviewed changes accumulate between
  releases. Protected — changes arrive only via pull request (PR). Work in
  progress is expected here; a known-broken state is not, because module IGs
  vendor `dev` itself while the template package is unpublished — see
  [how a module consumes this template](docs/workflows.md#how-a-module-consumes-this-template).
- **`feature/*`, `change/*`, `fix/*` — short-lived working branches.** Branched
  **off `dev`**, one focused change each, merged back into `dev` via PR, then
  deleted. Name them descriptively, e.g. `feature/add-terminology-page` or
  `fix/footer-contrast`.
  > **Why short-lived and off `dev`:** long-running branches diverge and become
  > painful to merge; small branches keep review cheap and history legible.

### The flow, step by step

1. Update your local `dev`: `git checkout dev && git pull`.
2. Create a working branch off `dev`:
   `git checkout -b feature/<topic>` (or `change/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`).
3. Make your change. Commit using Conventional Commits (cheat-sheet below).
4. Push the branch and open a PR **targeting `dev`**.
5. On green CI and review approval, the PR is **squash-merged** into `dev` and
   the working branch is deleted.
   > **Why squash into `dev`:** a squash collapses the branch's work-in-progress
   > commits into ONE clean Conventional Commit on `dev`. Each entry in `dev`'s
   > history then equals one reviewed change — which is exactly the granularity
   > the changelog is later built from.
6. To release: a maintainer opens a **`dev` → `main` PR** (the release-candidate
   gate — a human decision, not automated). That PR is merged as a **merge
   commit, not a squash**.
   > **Why the `dev` → `main` merge is a merge commit and not a squash:** the
   > release automation on `main` reads the individual Conventional Commits to
   > build an accurate changelog and pick the next version. Squashing `dev` →
   > `main` would collapse all accumulated changes into one commit, and the
   > changelog would collapse to a single line. The merge commit preserves every
   > commit that was squashed into `dev`, so nothing is lost.

gitGraph
  commit tag: "v0.1.0"

  branch feature/add-page
  commit
  checkout dev
  merge feature/add-page
  commit
  checkout main
  merge dev tag: "v0.2.0"
```

> Reads as: work happens on short-lived `feature/*` off `dev`; `dev` integrates;
> `dev → main` is the release, tagged by Release Please on `main`.

## Conventional Commits — cheat-sheet

Every commit message (and every PR title, since PRs are squash-merged) follows
the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
format:

```
<type>: <short description in the imperative>
```

| Type | Use it when you… | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feat` | add functionality (a new template feature, include, style) | `feat: add MII footer include` |
| `fix` | repair something broken | `fix: correct footer contrast on dark background` |
| `docs` | change documentation only | `docs: explain template versioning` |
| `chore` | do housekeeping (configs, licenses, .gitignore) | `chore: scaffold repository` |
| `ci` | change CI workflows | `ci: pin actions to commit SHAs` |
| `refactor` | restructure without changing behavior | `refactor: split header include` |
| `test` | add or fix tests/checks only | `test: add template build smoke check` |

Extras a novice should know:

- **Scope (optional):** `feat(includes): …` narrows where the change happened.
- **Breaking change:** add `!` after the type — `feat!: …` — and explain the
  break in the commit body. This triggers a MAJOR version bump.
- Keep the description under ~72 characters, imperative mood ("add", not
  "added"), no trailing period.

> **Why this format is mandatory:** the release automation derives the next
> SemVer version and the changelog *from the commit types* (`fix` → PATCH,
> `feat` → MINOR, `!` → MAJOR). A mistyped commit means a wrong version number.

## Pull-request rules

- **Small and single-purpose.** One logical change per PR. If you can describe
  the PR only with "and", split it.
- **Target `dev`** (never `main` — except the release PR opened by a
  maintainer).
- **Title** = a Conventional Commit line (it becomes the squash commit on
  `dev`).
- **Body** uses this format:

  ```
  ## Summary
  <what this PR adds/changes, bullet list>

  ## Rationale
  <why — reference the relevant docs/spec; call out non-obvious choices>

  ## How to verify
  <numbered, copy-pasteable steps a reviewer can run>
  ```

- CI must be green and review approval given before merge.
- Delete the working branch after the merge.

## Release automation

Release automation (Release Please) runs **on `main`**: it opens a release PR,
and merging that PR cuts the SemVer `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag, the `CHANGELOG.md`
entry and the GitHub Release. The steps are in
[docs/workflows.md](docs/workflows.md) §3.

> This repo uses SemVer; MII KDS *modules* use CalVer (`YYYY.n.n`) for their own
> releases. Why, and why not to mix them: [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md) §6.

## How this relates to the MII process

Everything above is **this repository's** workflow. It is not an MII rule, and
this repository does not speak for the MII.

The MII does publish rules for commenting on a Kerndatensatz module, and a
module that renders with this template will eventually sit inside them. They
are in the
[**KDS governance, version 4.0**](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/sites/default/files/2026-07/KDS-Governance-v4.pdf)
(PDF, 7 May 2026), adopted by the National Steering Committee and published on
the
[MII core-data-set page](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/medical-informatics-initiatives-core-data-set):

- **Where comments go.** After FHIR profiling, a module runs a commenting round.
  Comments are filed either through the HL7 Deutschland ballot portal **or as an
  issue in the module's own GitHub repository** (§5.1.2) — so a module's issue
  tracker is a sanctioned channel, not an informal one.
- **Who may comment, and for how long.** Anyone may comment; the round is
  announced in advance and runs for a defined window (§3.5.4). Voting on an HL7
  ballot is a separate matter and is restricted to HL7 Deutschland members.
- **The module team must answer.** Every comment is answered — accepted or
  rejected, with a reason (§3.5.4).
- **Comments are public by default.** A commenter may ask for their identity to
  be pseudonymised.

Two things the MII does **not** publish, which are worth knowing so you do not
go looking:

- **No code of conduct**, anywhere — see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **No `CONTRIBUTING.md`** in the MII organisation or in any KDS module,
  including the reference module `kerndatensatz-basis`. The one participation
  rule published organisation-wide is how to request GitHub access, on the
  [MII organisation profile](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md):
  email the Geschäftsstelle with the subject *"Zugang zum GitHub der MII"*.

> **Cite version 4.0, not what you may find first.** The
> `medizininformatik-initiative/kerndatensatz-governance` repository still
> announces version 3, ships no document and has not been touched since January
> 2024. Version 3.0's tooling chapter — GitHub, SharePoint, Simplifier, Zulip
> access — was **removed** in 4.0 and replaced by an appendix marked *in
> Arbeit*, so those instructions are no longer published guidance.
